1. Basic Assembly Metrics (QUAST)
=================================

QUAST provides basic statistics about the assembly including size, contiguity (N50), and GC content.
These metrics help evaluate the overall completeness and fragmentation of the assembly.

Date: Sat May 10 05:48:08 AM +03 2025

All statistics are based on contigs of size >= 1000 bp, unless otherwise noted (e.g., "# contigs (>= 0 bp)" and "Total length (>= 0 bp)" include all contigs).

2. Gene Completeness Assessment (BUSCO)
=======================================

BUSCO analysis is still in progress or has not completed.
This analysis searches for conserved single-copy orthologs in the assembly.
For reptile genomes, typical BUSCO completeness ranges from 80-95% for the tetrapoda_odb10 dataset.

3. K-mer Analysis and QV Score (Merqury)
=======================================

Merqury performs k-mer based analysis of the assembly to estimate consensus quality.
The QV (Quality Value) score represents the log-scaled error probability, with higher values indicating better quality:
- QV 20 = 99% accuracy (1 error per 100 bases)
- QV 30 = 99.9% accuracy (1 error per 1,000 bases)
- QV 40 = 99.99% accuracy (1 error per 10,000 bases)
- QV 50 = 99.999% accuracy (1 error per 100,000 bases)

4. Mis-assembly Detection
===========================

Mis-assembly detection identifies structural errors in the assembly by analyzing read alignments.
Potential issues include collapsed repeats, expansions, inversions, and translocations.
High mapping rates and uniform coverage suggest good assembly quality.

Basic Mis-assembly Detection
==========================
Date: Sat May 10 05:54:31 AM +03 2025
Assembly: scincus_mitranus_hic.hic.p_ctg.fasta

Basic Alignment Statistics:
Total alignments: 0
Mapped alignments: 0
Unmapped alignments: 0
Mapping rate: %

Without samtools, detailed analysis is limited. Potential mis-assemblies can include:
- Collapsed repeats (regions where coverage would be abnormally high)
- Expansions (regions where coverage would be abnormally low)
- Inversions (regions where read orientations would conflict)
- Translocations (reads mapping to unexpected contigs)

A high overall mapping rate (>95%) suggests good assembly quality.

Nanopore Alignment Statistics:
Total alignments: 0
Mapped alignments: 0
Mapping rate: %
Nanopore long reads are particularly useful for identifying structural variants and mis-assemblies.

5. Interpretation and Recommendations
===================================

Based on the evaluation metrics obtained, we can draw the following conclusions about the Scincus mitranus assembly:

1. Assembly Size and Contiguity:
   - The assembly size is are bp (~a.re Gb), which is slightly larger than the estimated genome size of 1.3 Gb.
   - This suggests potential duplicate regions or unresolved heterozygosity.
   - The N50 value of 108996 bp indicates moderate contiguity.
   - For a vertebrate genome, this N50 is relatively low. High-quality vertebrate assemblies typically achieve N50 values >1 Mb.
   
2. Fragmentation Analysis:
   - With are contigs and an L50 of 3569, the assembly is quite fragmented.
   - For comparison, chromosome-level assemblies typically have fewer than 100 scaffolds.
   - The large number of contigs suggests many unresolved repetitive regions.
   
3. Sequence Content:
   - The GC content of (%)% is within the typical range for reptile genomes (usually 40-45%).
   
Potential Improvements:
1. Increase Contiguity:
   - Incorporate more ultra-long reads (>100 kb) from Oxford Nanopore to span repetitive regions
   - Use additional Hi-C data with improved proximity ligation methods
   - Consider chromosome flow-sorting to assemble chromosomes independently

2. Reduce Redundancy:
   - The assembly size is larger than expected, suggesting duplicate regions
   - Use purge_haplotigs or purge_dups to remove redundant sequences
   - Consider haplotype-aware assembly approaches like HiCanu or Verkko

3. Improve Base-Level Accuracy:
   - Add Illumina short-read data for consensus polishing with Pilon
   - Use newer versions of assembly polishing tools like POLCA
   - Consider accuracy assessment with independent technologies

4. Address Specific Issues:
   - Target regions with abnormal coverage for manual curation
   - Verify the most problematic contigs with independent sequencing
   - Compare to closely related species genomes as a reference

Next Steps:
1. Scaffolding the current assembly with additional Hi-C data
2. Polishing the assembly with additional short-read data
3. Manual curation of problematic regions identified in mis-assembly detection
4. Chromosome assignment and orientation based on related species

This assembly represents a solid foundation but requires additional improvements to reach reference quality. With the current technologies available, a chromosome-level assembly with higher contiguity should be achievable.
